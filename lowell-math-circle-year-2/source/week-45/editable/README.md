# Week 45 The visible side editable source

## Current release: October 4, 2026 fresh-review revision

The guide now gives first routes, readiness-dependent continuation and return visits; original mathematical investigations are retained.

This is an unpiloted theme library, not a fixed meeting schedule. Select a manageable first route in the guide and return for further investigations. Preserve the full Grades 4–5 material. Prerequisites, launch, materials, hints and theorem-first mathematical overview are in the separate adult guide. Physical fit, demonstrations and classroom timing have not been tested.

Current pages: **K–1 4; Grades 2–3 4; Grades 4–5 4; adult guide 6**. Print selected student pages single-sided on US Letter at Actual Size / 100%.

## Rebuild outside the project

Extract the complete ZIP. Install Python 3 with `requirements.txt`, a normal TeX Live distribution providing pdfLaTeX/TikZ/Helvetica, and Poppler's `pdftoppm` where used by the existing checks. Matching guide fonts and licenses are included; the root build selects package-local fonts in earlier packages. No project checkout or original workspace path is needed.

    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    python3 build.py
    python3 verify_revision.py

The current verifier compares paper geometry and every 100-dpi rendered page against `reference-pdfs/`; timestamps may differ. It permits only specifically audited full-page font/hyphenation alternatives for unchanged student PDFs. See `review/fresh-review-rebuild.md` for actual results. The original strict verifier (`verify_rebuild.py` or `verify.py`) is retained and rejects those alternatives. The corpus report explicitly records any pre-existing small TeX font-metric differences for unchanged student bands; their current print/reference PDFs stay byte-identical. For Weeks 24 and 35, the detailed student-stage record is `review/student-reviser-fresh-review.md`. The corpus release report records those differences explicitly rather than calling them pixel-identical.

Edit student generators and their generated TeX in `src/` or `student-src/`. Edit the existing guide source under `facilitator-src/`. Where present, `facilitator-src/route-note.json` holds the concise starting/return update; the root build regenerates the guide before appending it exactly once. Do not run the appender alone against an already appended guide. Build intermediates belong in a separate working copy; inspect changed pages before updating references.

The current reference manifest is `review/reference-manifest.json`; revision evidence is `review/fresh-review-2026-10-04.md`. Older review files and `review/README-before-fresh-review-2026-10-04.md` describe their dated versions. Prior releases are archived outside the current package in the project.

## Use and rights

Original worksheet prose, diagrams and builders are provided for the organizer's use and adaptation. Preserve source attribution. Third-party books and articles retain their rights and are not redistributed here. Included fonts retain their licenses. No broader third-party license is implied. Routine adult reading or recording is allowed; children should retain the mathematical choices.
